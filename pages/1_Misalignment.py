    """
In this project, we investigate a case of **emergent misalignment** observed during model training.

We'll analyze:
- Representation drift across checkpoints
- Activation clusters over time
- Whether features coalesce or diverge

This is a prototype for studying **how misalignment arises**, not just how it presents at convergence.
